            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
             <li> *tips 1 : start with family & friends* family and friends are always
   supportive when you start something new.tell them that you have started a
   new business and would love to get their feedback.when you share the
   products with them, many will purchase the products and share their
   feedback.</li></br>
   <li>*tip 2: share fashion world hit catalog* begin with fashion world “popular &
   must share” collection. these are the most trending catalogs that have
   worked for every successful reseller. your customers will totally love it!</li></h4></br>
  <li> *tip 3: emphasise on cod & easy return* building trust online is
   tricky. you would notice how people hesitate to pay online upfront. to
   build trust with your potential customer, offer them cash on delivery
   (cod). this way, they only pay once they have received the product. in case
   your customer is not satisfied with the product, offer them the easy
   returns or exchange option. rest assured, we offer hassle free return &
   exchange.</li></br>
   <li> *tip 4: create the urgency factor* use phrases like, “i have only 2
   of these left” or “i can offer 50% off till tonight”. the purpose is to
   ensure that your customers see what they like and creating an urgency will
   help them determine their purchase.</li></br>
 <li> *tip 5: the secret recipe* initially, focus on building a loyal
   customer base. begin with making low profits and gradually increase
   it. this has worked for every successful reseller. initially, you can earn
   through meesho's weekly bonus program.</li></br>

            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
             <ol><li>Here are some simple ways to find customers on Whatsapp:</li>
Share Frequently Sharing a few products only on certain days isn't enough.You must share multiple products multiple times a day. Our top Resellers get maximum orders when they share products 2-3 times every day.
Share the Right Products Sharing the right products is as important as sharing frequently. If you share something that your customers love, then it will be easier for you to get orders.   So, ask your customers what they like and share accordingly.
Share with All Many times, we share only with a limited number of customers. These people may show some interest but may not buy. In this case, the only way to get an order is to share with more people!   Here’s how you can look for more customers
<li>Friends & Family: They’re always supportive when you start something new.</li>
<li>Neighbours: Tell them about your venture when you meet them next.</li>
<li>Friends of Friends: Ask your friends to refer their friends as customers. You can offer them a discount if they refer someone.</li>
